## **Key 
1. **Complete ors**
  system deployment** - Not just 
  model hosting, but entire RAG + 
2. orkflow + UI stack
  **Industry-specific templates** -
   Pre-configured for 
  legal/healthcare/finance use 
3. **Visual workflow 
  builder** - n8n integration lets 
4. sers customize without coding
  **Transparent pricing** - Simple 
5. **Enterprise l
  security** - Built-in compliance,
6. audit logging, access controls
   **Multi-cloud support** - Choice
7. of CoreWeave, AWS, GCP, Azure
  **Zero technical knowledge 
  required** - Complete abstraction
   of infrastructure 
## **Revenue 
- Simple 7% Markup:**
- Customer pays platform directly
- Platform pays cloud providers
  Example: $1,200/month hosting = 
  $1,284/month customer bill = 
  $84/month profit per 
- 100le Potential:**
   customers = $8,400/month 
- 500 customers nue
  = $42,000/month recurring revenue
- 1,000 customers = 
  $84,000/month recurring 
This is the complete 
  software plan - a platform that 
  automatically deploys and manages
   the entire $35K law firm 
  solution you built, but 
  self-service for thousands of 
  customers at scale.
